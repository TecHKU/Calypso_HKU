# Calypso_HKU

Calypso is a project collaboration platform that allows students to post, review and take part in different projects around the campus. For upcoming startups and projects, it is very hard to find diverse talent that can make their projects a reality while incoming students have a hard time finding interesting projects work on. To bridge the gap we envision Calypso as a platform designed for university students to innovate and collaborate better.
